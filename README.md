# Cooperative Federated Learning with Intelligent Selective Data Sharing

Traditional federated learning wastes a lot of resources, e.g., when selecting training clients, when sending model updates or *when keeping every data record private*.
In this repository, we created a cooperative federated learning in which the participants *can* share raw data among each other.

## Content

This repository contains source codes for:
1. simulating the traffic of a small generated town
2. defining different algorithms to select records to exchange between vehicles
3. analyzing the capabilities of the proposed system.
